                <h2>Operation Desert Storm</h2>
                <p>This was a propaganda art, by the americans. they made this for using it againts the iraqi. The Gulf War was an armed conflict between Iraq and a 42-country coalition led by the United States. The coalition's efforts against Iraq were carried out in two key phases: Operation Desert Shield, which marked the military buildup from August 1990 to January 1991; and Operation Desert Storm, which began with the aerial bombing campaign against Iraq on 17 January 1991 and came to a close with the American-led liberation of Kuwait on 28 February 1991.</p>
                <p>The result of the Jeddah talks was an Iraqi demand for $10 billion[66] to cover the lost revenues from Rumaila; Kuwait offered $500 million.[66] The Iraqi response was to immediately order an invasion,[67] which started on 2 August 1990[68] with the bombing of Kuwait's capital, Kuwait City. Before the invasion, the Kuwaiti military was believed to have numbered 16,000 men, arranged into three armored, one mechanized infantry and one under-strength artillery brigade.[69] The pre-war strength of the Kuwait Air Force was around 2,200 Kuwaiti personnel, with 80 fixed-wing aircraft and 40 helicopters.[69] In spite of Iraqi saber rattling, Kuwait did not mobilize its force; the army had been stood-down on 19 July,[70] and during the Iraqi invasion many Kuwaiti military personnel were on leave.</p>

                <h2>Secon Chechen war</h2>
                <p>The Second Chechen War (Russian: Втора́я чече́нская война́,[e] Chechen: ШолгIа оьрсийн-нохчийн тӀом, lit. 'Second Russian-Chechen War'[35]) took place in Chechnya and the border regions of the North Caucasus between the Russian Federation and the breakaway Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, from August 1999 to April 2009.</p>
                <p>The war was launched by the Russian Federation on 26 August 1999, in response to the Invasion of Dagestan by the Islamic International Brigade (IIB). The war ended with a Russian victory, the signing of the Khasavyurt Accord on 31 August 1996 and the establishment of a pro-Moscow Chechen government. The war led to the deaths of thousands of civilians and militants on both sides, as well as the displacement of 200,000 to 300,000 Chechens.</p>
                <p>By 2009, Russia had disabled the Chechen separatist movement and mass fighting ceased. Russian army and Interior Ministry troops ceased patrolling. Grozny underwent reconstruction and much of the city and surrounding areas were rebuilt quickly. Sporadic violence continued in the North Caucasus; occasional bombings and ambushes against federal troops and forces of the regional governments in the area still occur.</p>

                <h2>Battle of Mogadishu</h2>
                <p>The Battle of Mogadishu (Somali: Maalintii Rangers, lit. 'Day of the Rangers'), also known as the Black Hawk Down Incident, was part of Operation Gothic Serpent. It was fought on 3–4 October 1993, in Mogadishu, Somalia, between forces of the United States—supported by UNOSOM II—against Somali National Alliance (SNA) fighters and other insurgents in south Mogadishu.<p>
                <p>The battle is also referred to as the First Battle of Mogadishu to distinguish it from the Second Battle of Mogadishu in 2006. The initial U.S. Joint Special Operations force, Task Force Ranger, was commanded by Major General William F. Garrison and composed of elite special operations units from the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, and U.S. Navy SEALs, and the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR).</p>
                <p>Shortly after the task force was deployed to Somalia, the Somali National Alliance (SNA) declared war on the Americans. The SNA was led by warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid, who was a powerful figure in the Somali Civil War. The operation intended to capture Aidid. The operation was intended to last an hour, but it turned into an overnight standoff and rescue operation extending into daylight hours.</p>
                <p>After the battle, the bodies of several of the conflict's U.S. casualties (Black Hawk Super 64's crewmembers and their defenders, Delta Force soldiers MSG Gordon and SFC Shughart) were dragged through Mogadishu's streets by a large crowd of Somalis.[170] After being asked to justify the incident in an interview with American television, Captain Haad of Somali National Alliance claimed that the bodies of the U.S. soldiers had been dragged through the streets by enraged civilians/irregulars who had lost dozens of friends and family, and that the actual SNA soldiers had not partaken in the incident.[171] He would further point to the July 12, 1993, Abdi House Raid that had first led the SNA to begin target U.S. soldiers saying, "Wouldn't you be very sorry about 73 of our elder men, of our religious leaders, of our most prominent people, having their bodies mutilated—we collected parts of their bodies from the building in which they were attacked—if you were a son of one of those people killed on that day, what would be your situation, how would you feel?"[171] Several days after the incident, the SNA issued a public appeal, stating that despite the "wanton destruction and suffering beyond human comprehension" inflicted by UNOSOM II and US forces, the alliance urged respect towards the deceased, injured, and prisoners of war; in accordance with Islamic principles.</p>

                <h2>Aceh Tsunami and EarthQuake</h2>
                <p>On 26 December 2004, at 07:58:53 local time (UTC+7), a major earthquake with a magnitude of 9.2–9.3 Mw struck with an epicentre off the west coast of Aceh in northern Sumatra, Indonesia. The undersea megathrust earthquake, known by the scientific community as the Sumatra–Andaman earthquake,[8][9] was caused by a rupture along the fault between the Burma plate and the Indian plate, and reached a Mercalli intensity of IX in some areas.</p>
                <p>The sudden vertical rise of the seabed by several metres during the earthquake displaced massive volumes of water, resulting in a tsunami that struck the coasts of the Indian Ocean. A tsunami that causes damage far away from its source is sometimes called a teletsunami and is much more likely to be produced by the vertical motion of the seabed than by horizontal motion.[60]The tsunami, like all the others, behaved differently in deep water than in shallow water. In deep ocean water, tsunami waves form only a low, broad hump, barely noticeable and harmless, which generally travels at the high speed of 500 to 1,000 km/h (310 to 620 mph); in shallow water near coastlines, a tsunami slows down to only tens of kilometres per hour but, in doing so, forms large destructive waves. Scientists investigating the damage in Aceh found evidence that the wave reached a height of 24 m (80 ft) when coming ashore along large stretches of the coastline, rising to 30 m (100 ft) in some areas when travelling inland.[3] Radar satellites recorded the heights of tsunami waves in deep water: the maximum height was at 600 mm (2 ft) two hours after the earthquake, the first such observations ever made</p>
                <p>According to the final report of the Tsunami Evaluation Coalition, a total of 227,898 people died.[117] Another common total, as given by the UN Office of the Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery, is 229,866 dead.[118] Measured in lives lost, this is one of the ten worst earthquakes in recorded history, as well as the single worst tsunami in history. Indonesia was the worst affected area, with most death toll estimates at around 170,000.[119] The death toll for Indonesia alone may be as high as 172,761 lives.[120] An initial report by Siti Fadilah Supari, the Indonesian Minister of Health at the time, estimated the death total to be as high as 220,000 in Indonesia alone, giving a total of 280,000 fatalities.[121] However, the estimated number of dead and missing in Indonesia were later reduced by over 50,000. In their report, the Tsunami Evaluation Coalition stated, "It should be remembered that all such data are subject to error, as data on missing persons especially are not always as good as one might wish".[122] A much higher number of deaths has been suggested for Myanmar based on reports from Thailand.</p>

            <h2>Russian invasion of georgia</h2>
            <p>The Russo-Georgian War was a war between Georgia, Russia and the Russian-backed self-proclaimed republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The war took place in August 2008 following a period of worsening relations between Russia and Georgia, both formerly constituent republics of the Soviet Union. The fighting took place in the strategically important Transcaucasia region. It was regarded as the first European war of the 21st century.</p>
            <p>The Republic of Georgia declared its independence in early 1991 as the Soviet Union began to fall apart. The Georgian government launched a military operation against secessionist forces in South Ossetia in 1991, which was followed by a brief war in Abkhazia in 1992. Following the war, a joint peacekeeping force of Georgian, Russian, and Ossetian troops was stationed in the region. A series of incidents in the region of South Ossetia in the period 2004–2008 led to the eruption of military conflict between Georgian and Ossetian forces. The conflict was supported by Russia, which increased its military presence in the region and enlarged its peacekeeping contingent in the region under the mandate of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The war was an important event for the Russian government, which declared it a response to Georgian aggression and a demonstration of its readiness to defend its citizens and interests abroad.</p>
            <p>On 26 August 2008, the Russian Federation recognized Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states. In response to Russia's recognition of the breakaway regions, the Georgian government severed diplomatic relations with Russia. Russia's actions were widely condemned by Western countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, France, and the European Union. The European Union, the OSCE, and the United Nations General Assembly all called for the immediate withdrawal of Russian forces from Georgian territory. Russia responded by deploying troops in areas adjacent to Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and establishing buffer zones in both regions. The war displaced 192,000 people, and while many were able to return to their homes after the war, a year later around 30,000
            <p>Georgian troops were sent to the South Ossetian conflict zone on 7 August 2008. The Russian 58th Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Anatoly Khrulyov, was brought to the Georgian border. Russian forces occupied the Georgian cities of Zugdidi, Senaki, Poti, and Gori after the ceasefire agreement was reached. Russian Black Sea Fleet blockaded the Georgian coast. The Russian Air Force attacked targets beyond the conflict zone, in undisputed Georgian territory. This was the first war in history in which cyber warfare coincided with military action. An active information war was also waged during and after the conflict.</p>

            <p>On 17 August, Medvedev announced that Russian military would start to pull out of Georgia the following day. Prisoners of war were swapped by the two countries on 19 August. A Georgian official said that although his country swapped five Russian soldiers for fifteen Georgians, among them two non-combatants, Georgia suspected that Russia kept two more Georgians. On 22 August, Russian forces withdrew from Igoeti and the Georgian police proceeded in the direction of Gori. Russia claimed that withdrawal of Russian forces was finished; however, Russian checkpoints stayed near Gori and two Russian lookout stations stayed near Poti.</p>

            <h2>The bombing of USS cole</h2>
            <p>The USS Cole bombing was a terrorist attack against the United States Navy guided-missile destroyer USS Cole (DDG-67) on 12 October 2000, while it was being refueled in Yemen's Aden harbor. Seventeen U.S. Navy sailors were killed, and 39 were injured in the attack</p>
            <p>l-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attack. A U.S. judge has held Sudan liable for the attack, while another has released over $13 million in Sudanese frozen assets to the relatives of those killed. The United States Navy has reconsidered its rules of engagement in response to this attack. On 30 October 2020, Sudan and the United States signed a bilateral claims agreement to compensate families of the sailors who died in the bombing.[3] The agreement entered into force in February 2021.</p>
            <p>The first naval ship on the scene to assist the stricken Cole was HMS Marlborough, a Type 23 frigate of the Royal Navy, under the command of Captain Anthony Rix. She was on passage to the UK after a six-month deployment in the Persian Gulf. Marlborough had full medical and damage control teams on board, and when her offer of assistance was accepted she immediately diverted to Aden.[23] Eleven of the most badly injured sailors were sent via medevac provided by the French Air Force to a French military hospital in Djibouti and underwent surgery before being sent to Germany</p>
            <p>he destroyer's rules of engagement, as approved by the Pentagon, forbade guards to fire upon the small boat (which was not known to be loaded with explosives) without permission from Cole's captain or another officer. Petty Officer John Washak said that right after the blast, a senior chief petty officer ordered him to turn an M-60 machine gun on Cole's fantail away from a second small boat approaching. "With blood still on my face", he said, he was told: "That's the rules of engagement: no shooting unless we're shot at." He added, "In the military, it's like we're trained to hesitate now. If somebody had seen something wrong and shot, he probably would have been court-martialed." Petty Officer Jennifer Kudrick said that if the sentries had fired on the suicide craft, "we would have gotten in more trouble for shooting two foreigners than losing seventeen American sailors.</p>
            <p>President Bill Clinton declared, "If, as it now appears, this was an act of terrorism, it was a despicable and cowardly act. We will find out who was responsible and hold them accountable."</p>
            <p>On 19 January 2001, the U.S. Navy completed and released its Judge Advocate General Manual (JAGMAN) investigation of the incident, concluding that Cole's commanding officer Commander Kirk Lippold "acted reasonably in adjusting his force protection posture based on his assessment of the situation that presented itself" when Cole arrived in Aden to refuel. The JAGMAN investigation also concluded that "the commanding officer of Cole did not have the specific intelligence, focused training, appropriate equipment or on-scene security support to effectively prevent or deter such a determined, preplanned assault on his ship", and recommended significant changes in Navy procedures. In spite of this finding, Lippold was subsequently denied promotion and retired at the same rank of commander in 2007.</p>

            <h2>Aceh insurgency</h2>
            <p>he insurgency in Aceh, officially designated the Rebellion in Aceh (Indonesian: Pemberontakan di Aceh) by the Indonesian government, was a conflict fought by the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) between 1976 and 2005, with the goal of making the province of Aceh independent from Indonesia. The aftermath of a military offensive in 2003 and the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami brought an peace agreement and an eventual end to the insurgency.</p>
            <p>The conflict began in 1976 when Hasan di Tiro, a former Indonesian diplomat and leader of the Free Aceh Movement (GAM), declared Acehnese independence. The Indonesian government responded by launching military operations, and the conflict continued for decades. The Indonesian military launched a major offensive in 2003, and the conflict intensified. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami devastated</p>
            <p>the region, killing over 170,000 people in Aceh alone. The disaster led to a peace agreement between the government of Indonesia and the Free Aceh Movement, and the conflict ended in 2005. The peace agreement granted Aceh special autonomy and the right to implement Islamic law. The Indonesian government also agreed to withdraw its troops from the region. The peace agreement was signed in Helsinki, Finland, and was mediated by former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari.</p>
            <p>The conflict in Aceh was one of the longest-running conflicts in Southeast Asia. The conflict was marked by human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, torture, and disappearances. The conflict also had a significant impact on the region's economy, with many businesses forced to close due to the violence. The peace agreement in 2005 brought an end to the conflict, and Aceh has since enjoyed relative peace and stability.</p>

The aftermath of a military offensive in 2003 and the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami brought an peace agreement and an eventual end to the insurgency.</p>
            <p>In October 2004, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY) and Vice-President Jusuf Kalla were sworn in following the first ever direct presidential elections in 2004. Aspinall argued that before this, there was a balance between those in the Indonesian government who believed that a military victory was impossible and that negotiations were needed and hardliners who held on to the view that GAM could be entirely eliminated—the election of SBY and Kalla had tipped the balance in favour of the former position.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that while SBY was still a minister in the Cabinet of President Megawati Sukarnoputri, he had supported an "integrated approach" in which military measures were accompanied by efforts to negotiate with GAM.[95] Kalla, then a ministerial colleague of SBY's, also supported the restarting of talks with GAM in early-2004 (a time when the martial law in Aceh was still in effect and the military operation was in full swing).[96] During this time, Kalla, through his trusted intermediaries, made approaches to GAM's commanders in the field as well as its leadership in Sweden.[95] The positions of both the president and vice-president of Indonesia in favour of negotiations as a solution to the Aceh insurgency thus provided a platform for the eventual success of the Helsinki peace talks.</p>
